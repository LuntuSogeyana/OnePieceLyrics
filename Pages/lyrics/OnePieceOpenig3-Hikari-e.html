        <p>
          The world... What a glorious place<br>
          Seek freedom, and it will be lie stretched out before your eyes...<br>
          If the endless dream guides your restless spirit... seize it!
          Raise your flag and stand tall!
        </p>
        <chorus>
          <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
          <p>Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah!<br>
            I think back to the time when my search first began
            I left behind those shores of sand
            For the endless everlasting world out there
            I know that with this burning passion driving me
            Someday, somewhere I'll finally see
            The light I have searched for everywhere (ere-ere!)
          </p>
        </chorus>
        <p>
          When the summer sun is shining
          Shaking the sails of my heart I know
          (Fly away glum blue sea)
          A brand new world that had been hiding,
          Has opened up it's doors for me to go!
          (Fly away glum blue sky)
        </p>

        <p>
          Swaying in the troubled waves
          From all despair I can be saved
          For the horizon on the other side is
          Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
          Is what I aim for
        </p>

        <chorus>
          <h3>[Chorus 2]</h3>
          <p>
            I have to follow my dreams however crazy they seem,<br>
            and I won't stop till I get them, you will see.<br>
            You're all I need to have the stregnth to Believe...<br>
            Believe in wonderland!           
          </p>
          <p>
            And though I traveled far from where my search began
            Over seas of green and shores of sand
            Through the endless everlasting world out there
            I know that with this burning passion driving me
            (ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh)
            Someday, somewhere I'll finally see
            The light I have searched for everywhere
          </p>
        </chorus>
