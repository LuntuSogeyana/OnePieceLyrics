            "We Are! (One Piece)"
        </h2>
        <p>
            Wealth, fame, power!</br>
            Gold Roger
            the king of the pirates
            obtained this and everything else the world had to offer
            and his dying words drove countless souls to the seas!
            "You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything I gatherd
            together in one place
            now you just have to find it!"
    
            These words lured men to the grand line in pursuit of dreams greater than they dared to imagine!
            This is the time known as </br>
            <i>The Great Pirate Era </i>
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            [chorus]
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            Come aboard and bring along all your hopes and dreams!
            together we will find everything that we're looking for!
            <i>

        </p>
        
        <p>
            Compus left behind
            it'll only slow us down!
            Your heart will be your guide
            raise the sails, and break the helm!
            That legendary place
            that the end of the map reviels!
            It's only legendary till someone proves it real.
            Through it all, through all the roubled times
            through the heartache and through the pain
            Know that I will be there to stand by you!
            Coz i just know you'll stand by me!
        </p>

            So come aboard and bring along all your hopes and dreams
            Together we will find everything that we're looking for!

            if you wanna be our friend
