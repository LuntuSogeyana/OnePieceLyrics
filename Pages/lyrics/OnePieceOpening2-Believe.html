            "Believe (One Piece)"
        </h2>

        <p>
          Destiny...<br>
          Fate...<br>
          Dreams..
        </p>
        <p>These unstoppable ideals are held deep in the heart of man<br>
          As long as there are people who seek freedom in this life<br>
          These things shall not vanish from the earth...
        </p>
        <p>
          People tell me my heads in the clouds...<br>
          I don't care what they say cause i'm dreaming of you.<br>
          You are the treasure I found. <br>
          So bright, so bold, yet so elusive<br>
          it's hard to look away<br>
          even though it's blinding me<br>
          there are no words to describe how I feel inside<br>
          I'm really, really stuck on you UwU<br>
        </p>

            and I won't stop till I get them, you will see.<br>

            Believe in wonderland!           
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm gonna follow my dreams however crazy they seem,<br>
            I'm gonna share them with you a love so true.<br>
            You're all I want, together we can move on... <br>
            Live how we want to!<br>
            There is no limit to us, we have the power of love.<br>
            And we don't wanna live ordinary lives.<br>
            We have a chance to live in paradice...<br>
            BELIEVE IN WONDERLAND!
