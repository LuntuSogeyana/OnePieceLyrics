            "Believe (One Piece)"

        <p>
          Destiny...<br>
          Fate...<br>
          Dreams..
        </p>
        <p>These unstoppable ideals are held deep in the heart of man
          As long as there are people who seek freedom in this life
          These things shall not vanish from the earth...
        </p>
        <p>
          People tell me my heads in the clouds
          I don;t care what they say cause i'm dreaming of you
          You are the treasure I found. 
          So bright, so bold, yet so elusive
          it's hard to look away
          even though it's blinding me
          there are no words to describe how I feel inside
          I'm really, really stuck on you UwU
        </p>

        <chorus>
          <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
          <p>
            I'm gonna follow my dreams however crazy they seem,
            and I won't stop till I get them, you will see.
            You're all I need to have the stregnth t Believe
            believe in wonderland!           
          </p>
        </chorus>
